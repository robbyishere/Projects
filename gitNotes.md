# Git Notes

Tips and commands to remember for Git

- [ ] Move from Github Desktop to Git for Windows (Command Line)

When planning to squash commits, do not squash and push until finished with further changes. This will prevent commits showing multiple times in commit history.


Use SSH instead of HTTPS when cloning git repos to not have to use enter authentication all the time (requires prior SSH key setup on Github account).
